# Ant Colony System for Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem (ATSP)

This repository contains an implementation of the "Ant Colony System" (ACS) metaheuristic for solving the Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem (ATSP) using the Xpress Mosel programming language. The ATSP is a variation of the Travelling Salesman Problem where the distance from city A to city B is not necessarily the same as the distance from city B to city A.

## Overview

Ant Colony System (ACS) is a biomimicking metaheuristic that inspired by the foraging behavior of ants to find approximate solutions to difficult combinatorial problems. This implementation applies ACS to the Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem, leveraging a colony of artificial ants that probabilistically construct solutions and communicate via pheromone trails.

## Prerequisites

To run this implementation, you will need:

- Xpress Mosel installed on your system. You can download it from [Xpress by FICO](https://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization).

## Usage

Run the code from the FICO Xpress Mosel IDE with the provided TXT file.
